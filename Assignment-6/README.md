1 Implement complete autograd framework in python and numpy  and mnist classifier using the autograd framework.

Reference : grokking deep learning book and samples in github  - Please use this as example and implement from scratch. write unittests for your code.

Extra points : If you implement a new activation function, new optimizer and new loss function in this code.

 

2) MANDATORY : Build an CNN based image classifier (at least 3 - 5 categories) from a custom data set you acquire (either from images.google.com or other places

 

Implement in both keras as well as pytorch lightning (two colabs)
