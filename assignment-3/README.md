# Homework 3 assignment

### Part a
Using pure Numpy to build a 3 layer neural network (with relu nonlinearity) to train on data - pick appropriate number of neurons in each layer and just use relu for non linearity.

### Part b
1. use pure pytorch tensor datastructure to build the same - do not use the auto differentiation yet. 

2.  use the pure pytorch tensor data structure to build the same but with auto differentiation primitives

3.  use the pure pytorch linear modules etc.,. - high level primitives and build neural network

 

### Part c
1) use pure tensorflow tensor datastructure to build the same - do not use the auto differentiation yet.

2.  use the pure tensorflow tensor data structure to build the same but with auto differentiation primitives

3.  use the pure tensorflow keras  linear modules etc.,. - high level primitives and build neural network - make sure you use the Model subclassing (not the functional api or sequential api)
